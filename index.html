                  My name is Amjad (the "J" is NOT silent), it's Arabic and it
                  means Greatest Glory. Born in Wilmington DE, Grew up in the
                  middle east. came back to "DelaWHERE??" after finishing High
                  School. My coding journey started at a very young age in
                  Syria, my first program I "typed" was in QuickBASIC language.
                  I didn’t say "coded" because I didn’t know WTF I was typing! I
                  was 3rd maybe 4th grade my father opened the compiler on our
                  old (still alive) IBM XT 286, showed me a page with letters,
                  numbers and symbols (10 years later I learned it's called
                  "source code") and said: "If you type these lines exactly as
                  they appear, you'll make a PC game". I was curious I compiled
                  it and it ran!! since that time I’ve been fascinated and
                  interested in twisting and manipulating compurters.
